# Neural Networks Coursework

This project was developed as part of a group coursework during the autumn term of my third year at university. The project focused on implementing a neural network from scratch and performing hyperparameter tuning on a separate pre-designed neural network.

## Features

1. **Neural Network Implementation**:
   - Custom implementation of a neural network using foundational techniques.
   - Includes forward propagation, backpropagation, and training loops.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimized a pre-existing neural network for better performance.
   - Explored hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, activation functions, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For dataset preparation and evaluation.
- **Scipy**: For scientific and mathematical functions.
- **Torch**: For deep learning model implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later.
- Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
